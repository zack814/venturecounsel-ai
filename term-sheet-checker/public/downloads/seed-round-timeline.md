## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Starting outreach before materials are ready**
   - First impressions matter. Practice first.

2. **Meeting with dream investors first**
   - Save your best prospects for after you've refined the pitch.

3. **Letting the process drag**
   - Momentum matters. Set deadlines and create urgency.

4. **Negotiating every term**
   - Pick 2-3 important issues. Let the rest go.

5. **Signing without understanding**
   - Use tools like VentureCounsel.AI and get legal review.
