## When to Use a SAFE

**Choose SAFE if:**
- [ ] Speed matters (you want to close in days, not weeks)
- [ ] You're raising from angels or seed VCs
- [ ] You want to minimize legal costs
- [ ] You don't want debt on your balance sheet
- [ ] You prefer simplicity
- [ ] Your investors are familiar with SAFEs

**Types of SAFEs available:**
1. **Post-money SAFE with cap** (most common, YC standard)
2. **Post-money SAFE with cap and discount**
3. **Post-money SAFE with MFN** (no cap)

---

## When to Use a Convertible Note

**Choose Convertible Note if:**
- [ ] Investor specifically requires it
- [ ] Tax considerations favor debt in your jurisdiction
- [ ] You want the discipline of a maturity date
- [ ] Investor is from traditional finance background
- [ ] Regulatory requirements favor debt structure

**Note: Most of these are edge cases. SAFEs are almost always preferable.**

## SAFE Terms Explained

### Valuation Cap
The maximum valuation at which your SAFE converts to equity.

**Example:**
- SAFE: $500K at $10M post-money cap
- Series A: $50M valuation
- SAFE converts at $10M cap → Investor gets 5%

**Without cap:** Investor would get only 1% ($500K / $50M)

### Discount
Percentage reduction from Series A price.

**Example:**
- SAFE: $500K with 20% discount
- Series A: $2/share
- SAFE converts at $1.60/share (20% off)

### MFN (Most Favored Nation)
If you offer better terms later, earlier investors get those terms.

**Warning:** Be careful with broad MFN clauses—they can cause chaos.

---

## Convertible Note Terms Explained

### Interest Rate
Typically 4-8% annually. Increases the conversion amount.

**Example:**
- Note: $100K at 6% interest
- Conversion after 18 months
- Converts as: $100K + $9K interest = $109K worth of equity

### Maturity Date
When the note must convert or be repaid (usually 18-24 months).

**What happens at maturity:**
1. Convert at the cap (most common)
2. Extend the note (requires negotiation)
3. Repay (rarely happens)

### Conversion Triggers
- **Qualified Financing:** Automatic conversion at next equity round above threshold
- **Change of Control:** Usually converts or gets paid out
- **Maturity:** Converts at cap or repays

## Conversion Math Examples

### SAFE Conversion (Post-Money)

**Setup:**
- Post-money cap: $10M
- SAFE investment: $500K
- Series A: $20M pre-money, $5M raised

**Calculation:**
- SAFE ownership = $500K / $10M = **5%**
- This percentage is fixed regardless of Series A valuation

### Convertible Note Conversion

**Setup:**
- Cap: $10M
- Investment: $500K
- Interest: 6% over 18 months = $45K
- Discount: 20%
- Series A: $15M pre-money at $3/share

**Calculation:**
- Cap price: $10M / shares = ~$2/share
- Discount price: $3 × 0.8 = $2.40/share
- Conversion at lower price: $2/share (cap wins)
- Shares: ($500K + $45K) / $2 = **272,500 shares**

## Red Flags in Either Instrument

**Watch out for:**
- [ ] Full ratchet anti-dilution (never accept)
- [ ] Participation rights before conversion
- [ ] Automatic conversion at unfavorable terms
- [ ] Overly broad MFN clauses
- [ ] Redemption rights on SAFEs
- [ ] Short maturity (<12 months) on notes
