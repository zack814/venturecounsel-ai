## Template 1: Requesting Time to Review

**Use when:** You receive a term sheet and need time to review with counsel.

---

**Subject:** Re: [Company Name] Term Sheet

Hi [Investor Name],

Thank you for sending over the term sheet. We're excited about the possibility of partnering with [Fund Name] and appreciate your confidence in [Company Name].

I'd like to take a few days to review this carefully with our legal counsel and discuss it with my co-founder(s). Could we schedule a call for [Day, 3-4 days out] to discuss any questions that come up?

In the meantime, is there anything you need from us to keep things moving on your end?

Looking forward to working through the details together.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Template 2: Proposing Counter-Terms (General)

**Use when:** You've reviewed the term sheet and want to propose changes.

**Subject:** Re: [Company Name] Term Sheet - A Few Discussion Points

Hi [Investor Name],

Thank you again for the term sheet. We've had a chance to review it with our counsel and are very much aligned on the big picture. There are a few points I'd like to discuss:

**[Point 1 - e.g., Valuation]**
We were hoping to land closer to [X]. Based on [recent traction/comparable deals/market conditions], we believe this reflects the current opportunity. Would you be open to discussing this?

**[Point 2 - e.g., Board composition]**
We'd prefer to maintain a founder-majority board at this stage, with the structure of [proposed structure]. This has been the standard in most of the seed deals we've seen recently.

**[Point 3 - e.g., Vesting]**
Given that we've been working on this for [X months/years], we'd appreciate credit for time already served on any vesting requirements.

I'd love to find a path forward that works for both of us. Would you have time for a call this week to discuss?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Template 3: Pushing Back on Participating Preferred

**Use when:** The term sheet includes participating preferred (a major red flag).

---

**Subject:** Re: Term Sheet - Liquidation Preference Discussion

Hi [Investor Name],

Thank you for walking through the term sheet with us. We're excited about the partnership and aligned on most terms.

I wanted to discuss the liquidation preference structure. The current terms include [1x participating preferred / participating up to Xx], which we've found is uncommon in recent seed deals we've benchmarked against.

Most of the comparable rounds we've seen (and guidance from lawyers we've consulted) suggest that 1x non-participating preferred is the current market standard for seed investments.

Would you be open to moving to a non-participating structure? We believe it better aligns incentives—in successful outcomes, we all do well together, and in modest outcomes, you're protected with your 1x preference.

Happy to discuss on a call if that would be helpful.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Template 4: Negotiating Option Pool Size

**Use when:** The proposed option pool seems larger than necessary.

---

**Subject:** Re: Term Sheet - Option Pool Discussion

Hi [Investor Name],

Quick question on the option pool. The term sheet proposes a [X]% pool, which at our pre-money valuation of [$Y] would dilute existing shareholders by approximately [Z]%.

Based on our 18-month hiring plan, we anticipate needing approximately [lower number]% for key hires:
- [Role 1]: [X]%
- [Role 2]: [X]%
- [Role 3]: [X]%
- Buffer for additional hires: [X]%

Would you be comfortable with a [proposed number]% pool instead? This covers our actual hiring needs while being more capital-efficient.

If our growth exceeds expectations and we need to expand the pool, we can address that at the Series A when we'll have a better sense of team needs.

Let me know your thoughts.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Template 5: Accepting with Minor Modifications

**Use when:** You're ready to move forward with small changes.

---

**Subject:** Re: [Company Name] Term Sheet - Ready to Move Forward

Hi [Investor Name],

Great news—we've completed our review and are ready to move forward with [Fund Name].

The terms look good overall. Before we sign, I wanted to confirm a few minor clarifications:

1. **[Clarification 1]:** Can we confirm that [specific term] means [your understanding]?

2. **[Clarification 2]:** For the [information rights / other provision], we'd prefer [minor modification]. Would that work?

3. **[Clarification 3]:** On timing, our counsel estimates [X days] to turn documents once we sign the term sheet. Does that align with your expectations?

Assuming these work, we're ready to sign and move to definitive documents. Let me know if a quick call would help resolve these faster.

Excited to officially partner with [Fund Name].

Best,
[Your Name]

## Negotiation Principles

1. **Always negotiate in good faith.** The goal is a partnership, not a win.

2. **Pick your battles.** Focus on 2-3 important terms, not every line item.

3. **Be informed, not aggressive.** Know what's market, but stay collaborative.

4. **Everything is negotiable** until you sign. But relationship damage isn't reversible.

5. **Use silence strategically.** You don't have to respond immediately.

## When to Get Help

**Talk to a lawyer when:**
- Terms seem unusually aggressive
- You don't understand a provision
- The deal size exceeds $500K
