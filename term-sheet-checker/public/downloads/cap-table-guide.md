## What is a Cap Table?

A capitalization table (cap table) is a spreadsheet showing who owns what percentage of your company. It tracks:

- **Founders:** Your shares and vesting
- **Investors:** Preferred stock or SAFEs
- **Employees:** Option grants
- **Advisors:** Advisory shares
- **Option Pool:** Reserved for future grants

## Cap Table Basics

### Typical Pre-Seed Cap Table

| Shareholder | Shares | Ownership |
|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Founder 1 | 4,000,000 | 40% |
| Founder 2 | 4,000,000 | 40% |
| Advisor 1 | 200,000 | 2% |
| Option Pool | 1,800,000 | 18% |
| **Total** | **10,000,000** | **100%** |

### After $1M Seed Round ($10M Post-Money Cap)

| Shareholder | Shares | Ownership |
|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Founder 1 | 4,000,000 | 36% |
| Founder 2 | 4,000,000 | 36% |
| Advisor 1 | 200,000 | 1.8% |
| Seed Investors | 1,111,111 | 10% |
| Option Pool | 1,800,000 | 16.2% |
| **Total** | **11,111,111** | **100%** |

## Key Cap Table Terms

### Authorized Shares
The maximum number of shares your company can issue (set in Certificate of Incorporation). Typically 10-15 million at formation.

### Issued/Outstanding Shares
Shares that have actually been granted to shareholders. Always less than or equal to authorized.

### Fully Diluted Shares
All issued shares PLUS all shares that could be issued (options, warrants, convertible securities). This is what investors care about.

### Option Pool
Shares reserved for employee equity grants. Typically 10-20% at seed stage.

## How SAFEs Affect Your Cap Table

### Before SAFE Conversion
SAFEs don't appear on your cap table as shares—they're a promise of future equity.

**Track SAFEs separately:**
| Investor | Amount | Cap | Discount | Potential % |
|----------|--------|-----|----------|-------------|
| Angel 1 | $100K | $5M | - | 2% |
| Angel 2 | $250K | $8M | 20% | 3.1% |
| Seed Fund | $500K | $10M | - | 5% |

### At Conversion (Series A)
SAFEs convert based on their terms:
- Convert at valuation cap, OR
- Convert at discount to Series A price, OR
- Whichever gives investor more shares

## Dilution Math

### How Dilution Works

**Before investment:**
- You own 4M of 10M shares = 40%

**After $2M investment at $10M post-money:**
- Post-money = $10M
- Investor gets $2M / $10M = 20%
- Total shares increase to maintain percentages
- You now own 40% × 80% = 32%

**Formula:**
New Ownership = Old Ownership × (1 - New Investor %)

### The Option Pool Shuffle

**Watch out:** Option pools are usually created BEFORE investment, from the pre-money valuation.

**Example:**
- $8M pre-money valuation
- $2M investment
- 15% option pool from pre-money

**What investors see:**
- Post-money: $10M
- Their ownership: 20%

**What founders experience:**
- Pre-pool pre-money: $8M
- After 15% pool: Effective pre-money of $6.8M
- Real dilution: Higher than 20%

## Common Cap Table Mistakes

### 1. Not Tracking SAFEs Properly
Each SAFE should be tracked with:
- Investment amount
- Valuation cap
- Discount (if any)
- Date signed
- Investor information

### 2. Forgetting About the Option Pool
When calculating your ownership, always use fully diluted shares (including unissued options).

### 3. Confusing Pre-Money and Post-Money
- **Pre-money:** Company value before investment
- **Post-money:** Pre-money + investment amount

A $10M post-money with $2M invested = $8M pre-money.

### 4. Not Modeling Dilution Scenarios
Before raising, model out:
- What you'll own after this round
- What you'll own after Series A
- What you'll own at various exit scenarios

### 5. Messy Record Keeping
Keep track of:
- All stock purchase agreements
- 83(b) elections
- Option grants and exercises
- SAFE documents
- Any transfers or repurchases

## Founder Ownership Benchmarks

### At Seed (Post-Round)
| Scenario | Founder Ownership |
|----------|-------------------|
| Solo founder | 50-70% |
| 2 founders | 60-80% combined |
| 3 founders | 55-75% combined |

### At Series A (Post-Round)
| Scenario | Founder Ownership |
|----------|-------------------|
| Solo founder | 35-50% |
| 2 founders | 45-60% combined |
| 3 founders | 40-55% combined |

### At Series B (Post-Round)
| Scenario | Founder Ownership |
|----------|-------------------|
| Solo founder | 25-35% |
| 2 founders | 30-45% combined |
| 3 founders | 25-40% combined |

**Note:** These are rough benchmarks. Actual ownership depends on how much you raise and at what valuations.

## Exit Scenario Modeling

### Simple Exit Math

**Setup:**
- Founder owns 30% at exit
- Total preference stack: $10M (1x non-participating)
- Exit at $50M

**Calculation (non-participating):**
1. Investors choose: Take $10M preference OR convert to equity
2. 20% of $50M = $10M (same as preference)
3. Investors convert (or are indifferent)
4. Founder gets 30% of $50M = **$15M**

### With Participating Preferred

**Same setup, but with participating:**
1. Investors take $10M preference first
2. Remaining: $50M - $10M = $40M
3. Investors also get 20% of $40M = $8M
4. Founder gets 30% of $40M = **$12M**

**Difference:** $3M less to founders due to participation.
