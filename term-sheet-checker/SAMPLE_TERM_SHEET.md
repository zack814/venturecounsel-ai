## What to Expect from Analysis

This sample term sheet contains several **aggressive and red-flag terms**:

1. **2x Participating Liquidation Preference** - Extremely investor-heavy (market is 1x non-participating)
2. **Full Ratchet Anti-Dilution** - Deal killer for founders
3. **Redemption Rights** - Major red flag that can force insolvency
4. **8% Cumulative Dividends** - High and increases liquidation preference
5. **Overly Broad Protective Provisions** - Includes operational decisions (hiring, budget, debt limits)
6. **No Acceleration on Founder Vesting** - Founders lose unvested equity in M&A
7. **75% Voting Threshold on Protective Provisions** - Gives small minorities blocking power
8. **90-Day No-Shop** - Excessive (market is 30-45 days)
9. **Onerous Information Rights** - Monthly statements within 15 days, weekly metrics
10. **Forever Pro-Rata Rights** - Should terminate after 1-2 rounds
11. **Pay-to-Play Provision** - Signals lack of confidence

**The analyzer should:**
- Flag this as "Investor-Heavy" overall posture
- Identify redemption rights, full ratchet, and 2x participating pref as deal killers
- Provide alternative language for each problematic term
- Create negotiation plan prioritizing the most severe issues
- Note the cumulative effect of aggressive terms

Use this to verify the system is working correctly!
