### Long Description (300 words)
VentureCounsel.AI is the AI legal intelligence platform built specifically for first-time startup founders navigating fundraising.

**The Problem We Solve:**
Well-funded startups have armies of lawyers. First-time founders often sign whatever investors put in front of them—not because they're naive, but because they can't afford $5,000-$50,000 in legal fees to understand what's market vs. what's aggressive.

**Our Solutions:**

**Term Sheet Checker:** Upload or paste your term sheet and receive instant, market-calibrated analysis. We flag aggressive terms, identify deal-killers, and provide specific alternative language for negotiation. Benchmarked against 2024-2025 Silicon Valley data from NVCA, Cooley GO, and top law firms.

**SAFE Generator:** Create market-standard SAFE agreements based on official Y Combinator templates. Our step-by-step wizard guides you through valuation caps, discounts, pro-rata rights, and optional side letters. Export to Word documents ready for signing.

**Comp Optimizer:** Build competitive compensation packages for early hires. Quantify salary vs. equity tradeoffs, benchmark against startup market data, and create offers that attract top talent within your budget.

**Contract Review:** Analyze any contract—NDAs, vendor agreements, employment contracts—with AI-powered risk identification and plain-English explanations.

**Why Founders Choose Us:**
- Instant results in under 2 minutes
- Market-calibrated benchmarks (not generic AI responses)
- Specific redline language, not just explanations
- Free to start, no signup required
- Used by 2,500+ founders backed by YC, a16z, Techstars

**We're Not Lawyers:**
VentureCounsel.AI is a preparation tool, not legal advice. We help you understand documents and know what questions to ask before you're on the clock at $500/hour.

### Maker's Comment
Hey Product Hunt!

I built VentureCounsel.AI after watching too many first-time founders sign aggressive term sheets simply because they couldn't afford the $5K-$50K to have a lawyer explain what was standard.

The legal industry has gatekept this knowledge for too long. Terms that experienced founders would never accept get signed every day by people who just don't know better.

This isn't a replacement for lawyers—it's a preparation tool. Know what to ask before you're on the clock at $500/hour.

I'd love your feedback:
- What terms confuse you most?
- What features would make this more useful?
- Where am I over/under-weighting certain provisions?

Happy to answer any questions about fundraising patterns we're seeing!

### First Comment (for engagement)
Thanks for checking out VentureCounsel! Quick context on why I built this:

I've been on both sides of term sheet negotiations. As a founder, I signed things I shouldn't have. As someone who's now seen hundreds of term sheets, I see the same patterns repeat.

The three terms that trip up founders most often:
1. Participating preferred (the "double-dip")
2. Broad anti-dilution ratchets
3. Overly aggressive protective provisions

Would love to hear what terms confused YOU the most during fundraising!

Show HN: VentureCounsel.AI – AI term sheet analysis for first-time founders

### Body
Hey HN,

I built VentureCounsel.AI (https://venturecounsel.ai) to help first-time founders understand term sheets before signing.

**The problem:** Well-funded startups have legal teams. First-time founders often sign whatever investors put in front of them—not from naivety, but because they can't afford $5K for a lawyer to review a 3-page term sheet.

**What it does:**
- Paste your term sheet, get instant analysis
- Flags aggressive vs. market-standard terms
- Provides specific redline language for negotiation
- Benchmarked against 2024-2025 Silicon Valley data

**Technical details:**
- Built on Next.js 15 + Anthropic Claude API
- No account required—just paste and analyze
- Results in under 2 minutes

Free to use. Would love feedback from anyone who's been through fundraising—especially on terms I might be over/under-weighting.

Happy to answer questions about the legal patterns we're seeing in early-stage deals.

### Follow-up comment for engagement
Some patterns we're seeing in 2024-2025 term sheets that might interest HN:

1. Valuation caps are down ~30% from 2021-2022 peaks
2. More investors asking for participation in seed rounds (push back on this)
3. Information rights getting more aggressive (monthly financials becoming standard ask)
4. Pro-rata rights now expected even at seed

The shift from founder-friendly to investor-friendly market is real, but most terms are still negotiable if you know what to ask for.

### r/startups Educational Post

**Title:** After reviewing 500+ term sheets, here are the 5 clauses first-time founders consistently miss

**Body:**
I've spent the last year building tools to help founders understand term sheets, and I've reviewed hundreds of them in the process. Here are the patterns I keep seeing:

**1. The Option Pool Shuffle**
Investors will often ask for a 15-20% option pool to be created *before* the investment, carved out of the pre-money valuation. This effectively lowers your valuation by that amount. A $10M pre-money with a 20% pool is really an $8M valuation for founders.

*What to do:* Negotiate the pool size based on your actual 12-18 month hiring plan, not an arbitrary percentage.

**2. Participating Preferred (The Double-Dip)**
With participating preferred, investors get their money back *and* their pro-rata share of what's left. In modest exits, this can mean investors take 70%+ of proceeds even with much smaller ownership.

*What to do:* Push for non-participating preferred. It's now market standard at seed.

**3. Full Ratchet Anti-Dilution**
If you ever raise a down round, full ratchet reprices all previous investors as if they invested at the new lower price. Broad-based weighted average is standard and much more founder-friendly.

*What to do:* Never accept full ratchet. This is non-negotiable.

**4. Broad Protective Provisions**
Standard protective provisions cover major decisions (selling the company, new financing). Aggressive provisions can include approval for hiring, compensation changes, or even signing customer contracts above a threshold.

*What to do:* Push back on anything that affects day-to-day operations.

**5. Extended No-Shop Periods**
30-45 days is standard. 60+ days gives investors too much leverage and lets other opportunities slip away.

*What to do:* Keep it to 45 days max with clear closing milestones.

Happy to answer questions about any of these!

### r/SaaS Resource Post

**Title:** Free resource: The term sheet checklist we use internally (25 items)

**Body:**
We built an internal checklist for reviewing term sheets while developing our founder tools. Sharing it here since it might be useful:

**Economics (verify these first):**
- [ ] Pre-money valuation clearly stated
- [ ] Option pool size and whether it's in pre or post
- [ ] Liquidation preference (should be 1x non-participating)
- [ ] Anti-dilution (should be broad-based weighted average)
- [ ] Dividends (cumulative vs. non-cumulative)

**Control:**
- [ ] Board composition and voting
- [ ] Protective provisions scope
- [ ] Drag-along threshold
- [ ] Voting rights

**Founder Terms:**
- [ ] Founder vesting requirements
- [ ] Acceleration provisions (single vs double trigger)
- [ ] Non-compete/non-solicit
- [ ] IP assignment confirmation

**Investor Rights:**
- [ ] Pro-rata rights (and threshold)
- [ ] Information rights scope
- [ ] Registration rights
- [ ] Right of first refusal

**Process:**
- [ ] No-shop period length
- [ ] Closing conditions
- [ ] Expenses cap
- [ ] Legal counsel fees

**Red Flags:**
- [ ] Participating preferred
- [ ] Full ratchet anti-dilution
- [ ] Redemption rights
- [ ] Pay-to-play provisions
- [ ] Unusual veto rights

We also have this built into a free tool at venturecounsel.ai if you want the interactive version, but the checklist above covers the essentials.

## 5. Twitter/X Content Calendar

### Week 1: Foundation & Value

**Monday - Tip:**
Most first-time founders miss this about option pools:

A 20% pool carved from pre-money doesn't just dilute you 20%.

On a $10M pre-money:
- Investor thinks: "$2M for 20%"
- Reality: Their $2M buys 20% of $10M, but founders own 80% of $8M (after pool)

That pool comes from YOUR slice, not theirs.

**Tuesday - Thread:**
I've analyzed 500+ term sheets. Here are the 7 clauses investors always negotiate (and you should too):

1/ Liquidation preference
Standard: 1x non-participating
What investors ask for: 1x participating or 2x
What it means: How much they get before you in an exit
Push back? Always on participating preferred.

2/ Anti-dilution protection
Standard: Broad-based weighted average
What investors ask for: Narrow-based or full ratchet
What it means: Extra shares if you raise a down round
Push back? Absolutely on full ratchet. Never accept it.

3/ Board composition
Standard: Founder majority at seed
What investors ask for: Investor seat or balanced board
What it means: Who controls key decisions
Push back? Yes, especially at seed stage.

4/ Protective provisions
Standard: Major transactions only
What investors ask for: Approval on hiring, spending, contracts
What it means: Veto rights over operations
Push back? On anything affecting daily operations.

5/ Information rights
Standard: Quarterly financials
What investors ask for: Monthly financials, dashboard access
What it means: How much you report and how often
Push back? Monthly is excessive for most seed investors.

6/ Pro-rata rights
Standard: For lead/major investors
What investors ask for: Everyone gets pro-rata
What it means: Right to maintain ownership in future rounds
Push back? Only offer to meaningful check sizes ($100K+).

7/ No-shop period
Standard: 30-45 days
What investors ask for: 60-90 days
What it means: Exclusive negotiation window
Push back? Keep it under 45 days with clear milestones.

**Wednesday - Engagement:**

**Thursday - Behind the scenes:**
Interesting pattern in Q1 2025 term sheets:

Seed valuations averaging 15-20x ARR (down from 30-40x in 2021)

But here's what hasn't changed:
- 1x non-participating still standard
- Broad-based weighted average still standard
- 4-year vesting still standard

The economics changed. The structure didn't.

**Friday - Resource:**
New post on the blog: "How to Read a Term Sheet in 15 Minutes"

Covers the exact order to review terms, what's standard vs aggressive, and the questions to ask your lawyer.

### Week 2: SAFE Focus

**Monday - Tip:**
Post-money SAFEs changed everything.

Old way: Investor's ownership unknown until priced round
New way: $500K on $10M cap = exactly 5%

If an investor proposes an $8M post-money cap when you expected $8M pre-money, you're getting a worse deal.

Know the difference.

**Tuesday - Thread:**
SAFE side letters: What to include (and what to refuse)

1/ Pro-rata rights
Include for: Lead investors, $100K+ checks
Refuse for: Small angels, everyone equally

2/ Information rights
Include: Quarterly narrative updates
Refuse: Monthly financials, real-time dashboards

3/ MFN clause
Include: Limited to same financing round
Refuse: Applying to future priced rounds

4/ Board observer
Include: Major investors who add value
Refuse: Everyone who asks

Keep side letters simple. Every right you grant sets a precedent.

**Wednesday - Engagement:**
Find and quote a YC partner or notable founder on SAFEs

**Thursday - Insight:**
The MFN clause trap no one warns you about:

You raise $500K on SAFEs at $10M cap with MFN.
Later, strategic investor comes in at $8M cap.

With a broad MFN, ALL your early investors now get the $8M cap too.

One investor's terms just repriced your entire round.

**Friday - Resource:**
Ever wondered why YC changed from pre-money to post-money SAFEs?

Clarity.

With pre-money, more SAFEs = more founder dilution (confusing)
With post-money, each SAFE's % is locked in (transparent)

New blog post explains the full math.

---

### Week 3: Negotiation Tactics

**Monday - Tip:**
The best founders don't fight every term.

They identify 2-3 terms that matter most and trade the rest.

Valuation matters.
Liquidation preference matters.
Board composition matters.

Everything else? Leverage for what you actually care about.

**Tuesday - Thread:**
How to respond when an investor says "these are standard terms":

1/ Ask: "Standard for what stage and geography?"
Terms that are standard for Series B aren't standard for seed.

2/ Say: "Let me benchmark this against recent deals."
Buys you time and shows you're informed.

3/ Ask: "Which of these terms are most important to you?"
Opens negotiation without confrontation.

4/ Say: "I've seen [X] more commonly. Can we discuss?"
Shows you know the market without being adversarial.

5/ Remember: Everything is negotiable until you sign.

**Wednesday - Engagement:**
Share insight on someone else's fundraising thread

**Thursday - Data:**
Real data from 2024-2025 seed rounds:

- Median seed size: $2.5M (down from $3.5M in 2022)
- Median pre-money: $10-12M (down from $15-18M)
- Median dilution: 18-22%
- Most common instrument: Post-money SAFE

The market has normalized. Plan accordingly.

**Friday - Weekend thought:**
Unpopular opinion: The best time to learn term sheets is BEFORE you're fundraising.

When you're in the middle of a round:
- You're emotional
- You have time pressure
- Your leverage is unclear

Read a few term sheets before you need to.

---

### Week 4: Founder Stories

**Monday - Lesson:**
Biggest term sheet mistake I've seen:

Founder signed a 2x participating preferred at seed because "the valuation was good."

Company sold for $30M (a win!)
Investors took $6M (2x preference) + 20% of remaining $24M
Founder team split ~$19M across 60% ownership

Non-participating would have given founders $24M.

That preference cost $5M+.

**Tuesday - Thread:**
5 questions to ask before signing any term sheet:

1/ "What happens if we sell for 2x the post-money?"
Models the realistic exit scenario.

2/ "Can you walk me through the liquidation waterfall?"
Forces specificity on who gets paid what.

3/ "What triggers your protective provisions?"
Reveals hidden veto rights.

4/ "How have you handled down rounds with portfolio companies?"
Tests their founder-friendliness.

5/ "What's your expected ownership at Series A?"
Reveals follow-on intentions.

**Wednesday - Engagement:**
Engage with content about negotiation

**Thursday - Pattern:**
Investors who truly want to work with you will:
- Explain terms you don't understand
- Accept reasonable counter-proposals
- Not pressure you with artificial deadlines
- Share references from portfolio founders

Investors who don't:
- Rush you to sign
- Dismiss questions as "standard"
- Get defensive about negotiation
- Refuse to make introductions

Choose your investors like you'd choose a co-founder.

**Friday - CTA:**
Building something? Raising money soon?

Start understanding term sheets now—before you need to.

### Post 1: The Problem We Solve

I've watched too many first-time founders sign term sheets they didn't understand.

Not because they were naive. Because they couldn't afford the $5,000-$50,000 to have a lawyer explain what was standard.

The result?
- Participating preferred that costs them millions in an exit
- Board provisions that take away control too early
- Anti-dilution clauses that crush them in down rounds

Legal knowledge has been gatekept by ability to pay for too long.

That's why I built VentureCounsel.AI—a free tool that helps founders understand their term sheets before signing.

Not a replacement for lawyers. A preparation tool.

Because you should know what questions to ask before you're on the clock at $500/hour.

---

### Post 2: The Data

After analyzing 500+ term sheets, here's what I've learned:

First-time founders accept aggressive terms 3x more often than experienced founders.

Not because they're bad negotiators.
Because they don't know what's aggressive.

The terms that trip them up:
1. Participating preferred (looks standard, costs millions)
2. Full ratchet anti-dilution (nuclear option in down rounds)
3. Overly broad protective provisions (hidden veto rights)
4. Extended no-shop periods (kills optionality)

Experienced founders know to push back on these.
First-time founders sign them as "standard."

The information asymmetry is real.

But it doesn't have to be.

---

### Post 3: Market Calibration

"These are standard terms."

I hear this from investors all the time.

Here's the thing: Standard for WHO?

Terms that are standard for:
- A hot Series A ≠ standard for seed
- Bay Area ≠ standard for other geographies
- 2021 ≠ standard for 2025

When someone says "standard," ask:
- "Standard for what stage?"
- "Standard for what market?"
- "Standard as of when?"

The answer tells you a lot about whether you're actually getting market terms—or whether you're being anchored to something that benefits them.

---

### Post 4: Founder-Friendly Investors

Here's how you spot a truly founder-friendly investor:

**In the term sheet:**
- 1x non-participating preferred
- Broad-based weighted average anti-dilution
- Reasonable protective provisions
- No redemption rights

**In the process:**
- Explains terms you don't understand
- Gives you time to get legal review
- Accepts reasonable counter-proposals
- Introduces you to portfolio founders

**After signing:**
- Helps without micromanaging
- Shows up in tough times
- Supports follow-on fundraising
- Actually makes intros

Term sheets reveal character.
Choose investors like you'd choose a co-founder.

**Email 2: Day 2 (Educational)**

Subject: The 3 terms that cost founders the most equity

Hi [Name],

After reviewing hundreds of term sheets, three terms consistently cost first-time founders the most:

**1. Participating preferred**
Investors get their money back AND their percentage. In a $30M exit with $5M invested at 20% ownership:
- Non-participating: Investor gets $6M (converts to 20%)
- Participating: Investor gets $10M ($5M back + 20% of remaining)

That's $4M extra from founder pockets.

**2. Excessive option pools**
A 20% option pool from pre-money doesn't dilute the investor—it dilutes you. Negotiate based on your actual hiring plan.

**3. Full ratchet anti-dilution**
If you ever raise a down round, early investors get repriced to the new lower price. Broad-based weighted average is standard and much more reasonable.

Next time: How to actually negotiate these terms without killing the relationship.

**Email 3: Day 4 (Product Introduction)**

Subject: SAFE vs Convertible Note: Which is right for your raise?

Hi [Name],

Quick answer: For most seed-stage companies, use a SAFE.

**Why SAFEs win:**
- No maturity date pressure
- No interest accrual
- Simpler to close
- Well-understood by investors

**When convertible notes make sense:**
- Investor specifically requires debt structure
- Tax considerations in your jurisdiction
- You want the discipline of a maturity date

Either way, the key terms are the same: valuation cap and discount.

**If you're raising on SAFEs:**
Our SAFE Generator creates market-standard documents with optional side letters. Based on official YC templates.

**Email 4: Day 7 (Social Proof + CTA)**

Subject: What $180M in analyzed deals taught us

Hi [Name],

After analyzing term sheets representing $180M+ in startup deals, here's what we've learned:

**The market has shifted:**
- Median seed valuations down 20-30% from 2021
- More investors asking for participation (push back)
- Information rights getting more aggressive
- But structural terms (1x non-participating, weighted average anti-dilution) remain standard

**The information gap is real:**
First-time founders accept aggressive terms 3x more often than experienced founders—not because they're worse negotiators, but because they don't know what's aggressive.

**What you can do:**
1. Know the market before you negotiate
2. Identify 2-3 terms that matter most
3. Use everything else as trading chips
4. Get a reality check before signing

Our tools have helped 2,500+ founders get that reality check:
- Term Sheet Checker → Instant analysis
- SAFE Generator → Market-standard docs
- Comp Optimizer → Competitive offers

## 9. Quora Answer Templates

### Question: "What should I look for in a startup term sheet?"

**Answer:**

After reviewing hundreds of term sheets, here's my checklist for what to focus on:

**Economics (look at these first):**

1. **Pre-money valuation** - This determines how much you're giving away. Make sure you understand if the option pool is included in pre-money (it usually is, which effectively lowers your valuation).

2. **Liquidation preference** - 1x non-participating is standard. This means investors get their money back OR convert to their ownership percentage, whichever is higher. Avoid participating preferred if possible.

3. **Anti-dilution** - Broad-based weighted average is standard. Never accept full ratchet—it can be devastating in a down round.

4. **Option pool** - 10-15% is typical at seed. Push back if investors want 20%+ carved from pre-money.

**Control (these determine who makes decisions):**

5. **Board composition** - At seed, founder majority or a balanced board (2 founders + 1 investor) is reasonable. Investor majority is aggressive.

6. **Protective provisions** - These are veto rights. Standard ones cover major transactions (selling the company, new debt, etc.). Aggressive ones cover hiring, compensation, or customer contracts.

**Red flags to walk away from:**

- 2x+ liquidation preference at seed
- Full ratchet anti-dilution
- Investor board majority at seed
- Redemption rights
- Excessive protective provisions

There are tools like VentureCounsel.AI that can analyze your specific term sheet against market benchmarks if you want a detailed review before signing.

### Question: "How do I negotiate my first term sheet?"

**Answer:**

First-time founder here's my advice after seeing hundreds of negotiations:

**1. Don't try to win every point.**

Identify 2-3 terms that matter most to you and be willing to trade the rest. Trying to negotiate everything makes you look difficult and can kill the deal.

**Priority terms to focus on:**
- Valuation / dilution
- Liquidation preference
- Board composition

**2. Never say "this is unfair" or "this is aggressive."**

Instead say: "I've seen [X] more commonly in recent deals. Can we discuss?" This shows you're informed without being confrontational.

**3. Ask "why" questions.**

"Can you help me understand why you need monthly financials rather than quarterly?"

This opens dialogue and sometimes reveals that the investor doesn't feel strongly about the term.

**4. Use time strategically.**

"Let me review this with my lawyer and come back with thoughts." Buys you time to research and prepare.

**5. Know your BATNA.**

If you have other interested investors, you have leverage. If you don't, be more careful about pushing too hard.

**6. Get legal help.**

Term sheets are binding on many terms. A startup lawyer will cost $2-5K for a review—worth it compared to signing something bad.

Good luck!
